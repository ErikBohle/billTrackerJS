# JavaScript bill tracker
This is a bill tracker i made in JavaScript.

It takes multiple inputs and calculates a total, It only takes in numbers as inputs.

It also displays the history of inputs and shows different color for whether or not it's positive or negative.

You can remove individual inputs and it will update the total.

In this project i focused on the javascript part and not style, you can view the script athttps://github.com/ErikBohle/billTrackerJS/blob/master/app/scripts/app.js
